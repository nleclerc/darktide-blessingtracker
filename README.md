# Darktide Blessing Tracker (Unofficial)

Tracking what blessings you have extracted in Darktide is very hard.
Using this page you can know which one you have and/or need.
Everything is stored in localStorage so data is linked to your browser.

Weapon data was taken from the [darkmass repo](https://github.com/Cortex-Network/Darkmass-Source-Code/tree/main/app/json).

I'm not affiliated with Fatshark, this is only a fan project.
